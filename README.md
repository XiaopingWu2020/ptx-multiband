# ptx-multiband
This is a matlab toolbox for designing parallel transmit (pTx) multiband (MB) RF pulses.
You may run the demo script, `ptxMB.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design band-specific pTx MB multispokes pulses by solving regularized minimization. 
You may run the demo script, `ptxMB_peakpowctrl.m`, to grab an idea of how this toolbox can be used to design band-specific pTx MB multispokes pulses by solving minimization with explicit peak RF power constraints (formulated based on composite multiband RF waveforms). 
Note that for the pulse designers included to run successfully, you will need to install the matlab software for disciplined convex programming (which can be found at http://cvxr.com/cvx/).
